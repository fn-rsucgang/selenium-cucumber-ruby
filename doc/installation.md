Installation
============
### Prerequisites (for Mac)
You need to have Ruby installed. Mac already has Ruby installed but you may need to have a newer version.
Install Homebrew. Run: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Run: brew install ruby
Add Ruby to your path: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/bin
Restart your terminal/IDE
Verify your installation by running ruby -v in a terminal - it should print "ruby 1.9.3" (or higher).

You need to have DevKit installed (for Windows users)
You can get Ruby and DevKit from [RubyInstaller.org](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
